# Aubergine

At the very start of my coding journey I wanted to practice my skills and get stuck in and complete some puzzles.
In this repository I have stored my solutions to various puzzles. Most of the puzzles are from Project Euler or Codecademy.
I have primarily worked in JavaScript and Python (sometimes in Jupyter Notebook).
I have enjoyed working through these puzzles and applying my ever growing knowledge to create solutions.
